This software is a computer program whose purpose is to annotate protein/protein-coding gene sequences
within an ACNUC sequence database with homologous gene family identifiers, as would have been generated 
by a sequence homology clustering algortihm. This is a key part of production of HOGENOM databases 
(Penel et al. 2009 BMC Bioinformatics, 10(S6):S3).
